# MixStarter setup
To properly set up the app, you must be able to connect to MixStarter's database. For that purpose, I will paste a link to the database script here. Configure the datasource.properties file in order for it to showcase the correct url, user and password combination for this connection to happen. You can also access the GitHub repository of the project below.
